            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            toMOTko was born of need for a tool that could run on my 
            Zaurus C-1000 PDA and help me to learn/acquire new vocabulary 
            in Japanese and Spanish.  At the same time, I was very curious 
            about <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a> library and 
            <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia">Qtopia</a> environment and had the desire to 
            do some C++ programming, something I hadn't done for quite a long time.
            </p><p>
            The name of the application is pronounced "to-MO-ko".  It's a common first name
            for a Japanese woman.  I chose it thinking it would give a more human and nice/cute aspect
            to my application.
            So, a user could imagine that Tomoko Sensei is teaching him/her some new vocabulary.  
            I altered the name slightly to make it special and unique.  Hence, MOT means "word" 
            in French (my mother tongue).
            </p><p>
            The application is very simple.  It asks words repetitively in a way 
            similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">Leitner System</a>.  
            It allows the user to add/remove/edit words.  It works on Zaurus C-1000 PDA.  
            It should work on similar models as well as any computers with ARM-based 
            processor using Qt/Qtopia environment.  The development is made on an old Pentium-III
            laptop running Linux and using QT SDK for cross-compiling.
            </p><p>
            For the moment, it only supports Japanese-English cards with only 
            one deck of cards.  But I intend to support other languages (especially Spanish) 
            and provide functionality to handle more than one deck/group of cards/words.
