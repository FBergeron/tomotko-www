            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            toMOTko is a small Zaurus application for learning new vocabulary in a foreign language.
            </p><p>
            Since version 0.11.1, toMOTko works also on Windows, at last!  A port for Linux and MacOS X
            is also expected in the coming months.
            </p><p>
            Since version 0.6.0, toMOTko supports several languages even though the default settings
            are for English speakers learning Japanese. 
            </p><p>
            toMOTko was born of need for a tool that could run on my 
            PDA and help me to learn/acquire new vocabulary 
            in Japanese and Spanish.  I was tired of using flashcards that
            are cumbersome and time-consuming to make.  Also, I discovered that 
            I had a tendency to remember more the appearance of the flashcard than the 
            words themselves.  
            </p><p> 
            At the same time, I was very curious 
            about <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a> library and 
            <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia">Qtopia</a> environment and had the desire to 
            do some C++ programming, something I hadn't done for quite a long time (about 10 years).
            </p><p>
            The name of the application is pronounced "to-mo-ko".  It's a common first name
            for a Japanese woman.  I chose it thinking it would give a more "human" and nice/cute aspect
            to my application.
            So, a user could imagine that Tomoko Sensei is teaching him/her some new vocabulary.  
            I altered the name slightly to make it special and unique.  Hence, MOT means "word" 
            in French (my mother tongue) as this is what this application is all about : words.
            </p><p>
            The application is very simple.  It asks words (or whatever you feel to put in the text fields) 
            repetitively in a way 
            similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">Leitner System</a>.  
            The algorithm is not perfect yet but it's already good enough to facilitate new vocabulary acquisition.
            It provides a Glossary Manager that allows the user to add/remove/edit words 
            in a hierarchical structure that is convenient to efficiently
            select or unselect groups of words to memorize/learn.  
            </p><p>
            It presently works on Zaurus SL C-1000 PDA (Sharp ROM) and Windows (since 0.11.1).  
            In theory, it should work on similar models (SL serie) as well as any computers with ARM-based 
            processor using Qt/Qtopia environment (but this has never been personally experimented
            and may require modifications in the source code).  If you have a different model, let me know
            (by email) if toMOTko works or not on it.
            </p><p>
            The development is made on a dual-boot machine running <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux (Lenny)</a>,
            on which I installed Qt SDK to cross-compile and build the application, and Windows XP Professional, on which I
            installed Qt-4.4.1 SDK (open source edition). I also use <a href="www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu</a> and <a href="fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>
            running inside <a href="www.virtualbox.org">Virtual Box</a>.
