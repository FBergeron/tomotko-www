            <h2>About</h2>
            <p>
            toMOTko is a small Zaurus application for English speakers learning Japanese. 
            It's a customizable flashcard program that asks words repetitively to acquire new 
            vocabulary and memorize kanji readings/writings.
            </p><p>
            toMOTko was born of need for a tool that could run on my 
            PDA and help me to learn/acquire new vocabulary 
            in Japanese and Spanish.  I was tired of using flashcards that
            are cumbersome and time-consuming to make.  Also, I discovered that 
            I had a tendency to remember more the appearance of the flashcard than the 
            words themselves.  
            </p><p> 
            At the same time, I was very curious 
            about <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qt">Qt</a> library and 
            <a href="http://www.trolltech.com/products/qtopia">Qtopia</a> environment and had the desire to 
            do some C++ programming, something I hadn't done for quite a long time (about 10 years).
            </p><p>
            The name of the application is pronounced "to-mo-ko".  It's a common first name
            for a Japanese woman.  I chose it thinking it would give a more "human" and nice/cute aspect
            to my application.
            So, a user could imagine that Tomoko Sensei is teaching him/her some new vocabulary.  
            I altered the name slightly to make it special and unique.  Hence, MOT means "word" 
            in French (my mother tongue) as this is what this application is all about : words.
            </p><p>
            The application is very simple.  It asks words (or whatever you feel to put in the text fields) 
            repetitively in a way 
            similar to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard">Leitner System</a>.  
            The algorithm is not perfect yet but it's already good enough to facilitate new vocabulary acquisition.
            It provides a Glossary Manager that allows the user to add/remove/edit words 
            in a hierarchical structure that is convenient to efficiently
            select or unselect groups of words to memorize/learn.  
            </p><p>
            It presently works on Zaurus SL C-1000 PDA (Sharp ROM).  
            In theory, it should work on similar models (SL serie) as well as any computers with ARM-based 
            processor using Qt/Qtopia environment (but this has never been personally experimented
            and may require modifications in the source code).  If you have a different model, let me know
            (by email) if toMOTko works or not on it.
            </p><p>
            The development is made on two spare computers I have at my disposal : an old Pentium-III
            laptop running <a href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU/Linux</a> and an older Pendtium I running 
            <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com">Ubuntu Breezy Badger</a>.  
            Naturally, I installed Qt SDK on both machines for cross-compiling and building the application.
            </p><p>
            For the moment, it only supports Japanese-English.  But I intend to support other 
            languages (especially Spanish).
            </p><p>
            Features to implement (ordered by priority) :<br/>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Some statistics (word count, percentage of success/misses, etc.)</li>
                <li>Improve the glossary manager (we should be able to move folders easily, etc.)</li>
                <li>Add buttons to ease word selection for quiz.</li>
                <li>Use the statistics to initialize the TermScheduler.</li>
                <li>External web repository where people can upload/download glossary files.</li>
                <li>Keep/restore state when quitting/starting the application.</li>
                <li>Support for other languages (minimally Spanish and French).</li>
                <li>Make it work for other platforms.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
